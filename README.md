This tool graphs customer service team calls for a 1-day period at iSmartAlarm, displaying start-time and end times for each day.

The purpose of this is to help customer service management team visually see how many times each day all 3 call-lines are being tapped. This data will help advocate for:
- the need for additional customer service representatives
- the need to reduce call volume
- the need to upgrade the existing phone system to one that supports additional features such as call queues and automated assistant

Excel data was received from the customer service team, and converted to JSON.
Data is then visualized using [Highcharts'](http://www.highcharts.com/) interative graphing library.
